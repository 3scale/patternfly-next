# Process

This is an outline of the shared steps for building solutions for the web. It
states the essential phases that all development projects have a variant of. Projects may combine and loop some of the phases, but they will still exist in some
capacity.

This is not meant to outline a way of building our library.

This is not a recommendation for a process we should adopt.

The document is meant to be used as a starting point to help everyone
contribute meaningful feedback when we are ready to begin building the system. It
is also meant to help everyone pinpoint how different phases of the process affect
them, and how they affect the others.

  |- get information about the problem we are trying to solve
  |- communicate information about the problem we are trying to solve

## Assessment

#### Get Information About The Problem We Are Trying To Solve

Tasks:

- get information
- analyze information
- decipher relevant information
- clearly communicate the problem

Concerns:

- inaccurate information
- unusable information
- breaking modularization rules

Deliverables:

- TBA

## Design

#### Create The Initial Static Design

Tasks:

- create visual representation of a proposed solution
- communicate the visual representation
- breaking modularization rules

Concerns:

- inconsistent implementations
- breaking modularization rules

Deliverables:

- TBA

## Develop

#### Write The Code

Tasks:

- write the code
- write the automated tests
- write the documentation
- contribute code to project

Concerns:

- scenarios and states that are unaccounted for
- inconsistent implementations
- breaking modularization rules
- uncommunicated changes
- delays of integration into project

Deliverables:

- TBA

## Release
