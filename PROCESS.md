## Assessment

#### Get Information About The Problem We Are Trying To Solve

Tasks:

- get information
- analyze information
- decipher relevant information
- clearly communicate the problem

Concerns:

- inaccurate information
- unusable information
- breaking modularization rules

## Design

#### Create The Initial Static Design

Tasks:

- create visual representation of a proposed solution
- communicate the visual representation
- breaking modularization rules

Concerns:

- inconsistent implementations
- breaking modularization rules

## Develop

#### Write The Code

Tasks:

- write the code
- write the automated tests
- write the documentation
- contribute code to project

Concerns:

- scenarios and states that are unaccounted for
- inconsistent implementations
- breaking modularization rules
- uncommunicated changes
- delays of integration into project

## Release

#### Run Automated Tests

#### Prepare And Optimize The Code For Production

#### Distribute The Code For Consumers
